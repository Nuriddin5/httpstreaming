# Project Title: HTTP Streaming with Spring Boot and React.js

**Description:**
This project explores implementing HTTP streaming with Spring Boot on the backend and React.js on the frontend. It enables efficient real-time communication between server and client, ideal for applications needing near-real-time updates without WebSocket connections.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes Spring Boot for backend HTTP streaming endpoints.
- Implements React.js for consuming streamed data on the frontend.
- Demonstrates long-polling and other HTTP streaming techniques.
- Provides a structured example for integrating Java and JavaScript.
- Suitable for learning HTTP streaming, Spring Boot, and React.js interactions.

**Project Structure:**
- `/backend`: Contains Spring Boot backend code.
- `/frontend`: Holds React.js frontend code.
- `README.md`: Offers setup instructions and streaming concepts.

**Usage:**
1. Clone repository.
2. Navigate to `/backend`, run Spring Boot app.
3. In another terminal, navigate to `/frontend`, start React.js server.
4. Access app in browser to see HTTP streaming.
